I did manage to find a StackOverflow talking about my issue, but the answers were not the solution I was looking for:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54275069/module-not-found-error-cant-resolve-net-in-node-modules-stompjs-lib
People were suggesting to install the `net` package -- something found serverside in Node.js -- so that the clientside would have access to the library. 

Well, this is _not_ what I wanted to do with my database calls.

The fourth answer brought a friendly website and something more in-tune with my thoughts:

Version 2 (probably merge these writings...):

Components of computer systems can generally be placed into one of the following boxes:

* Hardware
* Software
* Peopleware

Everyone's heard of the first two. But the third isn't discussed as much.

It's an umbrella term to "refer to anything that has to do with the role of people in the development or use of computer software and hardware systems" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware). 

Computers don't do much without people around. Maybe that will change soon, with the looming rise of our AI overlords (_cite something that provides authority, but also shows I'm being sarcastic_), but until then people will still be needed.

There are two specific aspects that I want to focus on. (I think most of "peopleware" boils down to these two anyways, but yeah, we're talking about these two.):

* Developers
* Human-computer interaction
