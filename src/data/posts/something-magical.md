Once upon a time, while lurking in the chat of [a mystical keyboard wrangler](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), I came across the scribings of one _lumpywizard_:

> If something magical is done for you, it stays magical until you break it or remove it.

Breaking magic is like when a kid takes apart a pen to see how it works. 

Or like when someone disassembles and reassembles a car engine.

Or like when someone configures Vim from scratch.

Magic is just an illusion. Learn to break magic, and you can learn _anything_.
