Once upon a time, while lurking in the chat of [a mystical keyboard wrangler](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), I happened upon the scribings of one _lumpywizard_:

> If something magical is done for you, it stays magical until you break it or remove it.

You know, like when a kid takes apart a pen to see how it works. 

Or like when someone disassembles and reassembles a car engine.

THIS DOESN'T QUITE FIT. Or like when someone writes [an operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TempleOS) from scratch.
