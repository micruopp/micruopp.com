Once upon a time, while lurking in the chat of [a mystical keyboard wrangler](https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen), I happened upon the scribings of one _lumpywizard_:

> If something magical is done for you, it stays magical until you break it or remove it.

Kind of like when a kid takes apart a pen to see how it works (or just to fling the spring). Or like when someone disassembles and reassembles a car engine. Or like when someone configures Vim from scratch.

Magic is just an illusion. Learn magic, and you can learn _anything_.
