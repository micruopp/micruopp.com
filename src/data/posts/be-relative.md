# don't be agile. be relative






So... does it work or not?


## A Basic Workflow

Sprint workflow:
1. Create **Sprint Backlog** from **Product Backlog**


Boiled down, we have (constants):
1. Hold a meeting to decide on what stuff there is to do.
2. Do the stuff, checking in everyday on how the stuff is going.
3. Hold a meeting to review the stuff and how it was done.

Variables in scrum:
- How much time is spent planning and reviewing
- Frequency of dailies, depending on environment.
